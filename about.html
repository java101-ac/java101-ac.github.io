  <h1>About Java Quizzes</h1>
  <p>
    Java Quizzes contains multiple chapter exercises designed to quickly test your comprehension of core Java concepts.
    Quizzes are not comprehensive, but should give you a rough idea of whether you understand the basics.
    Java Quizzes is a project by Andrew Chen. Check out <a href="https://java101.org">Java 101</a> for more information.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Format</h2>
  <p>
    Each quiz contains multiple-choice questions.
    Questions may ask you to:
    <ul>
      <li>Describe a code's output</li>
      <li>Identify valid/invalid syntax</li>
      <li>Select code to achieve a desired output</li>
    </ul>
    
    Solutions with explanations are provided at the bottom of each quiz.  
  </p>

  <h2>Note</h2>
  <p>
    There is no better way to improve at programming (in Java or other language) than to get in front of a computer and code.
    No multiple choice quiz will help you become a proficient programmer. View this website as a "bonus resource" for your Java learning.
