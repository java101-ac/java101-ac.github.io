  <h1>About Java Quizzes</h1>
  <p>Java Quizzes contains multiple chapter exercises designed to quickly test your comprehension of core Java concepts.</p>
  <p>Quizzes are not comprehensive, but should give you a rough idea of whether you understand the basics.</p>
  <p>Java Quizzes is a project by Andrew Chen. Check out <a href="https://java101.org">Java 101</a> for more information.</p>
  <h2>Format</h2>
  <p>Each quiz contains multiple-choice questions. Solutions with explanations are provided at the bottom of each quiz.</p>

  <h2>Note</h2>
  <p>There is no better way to improve at programming (in Java or other language) than to get in front of a computer and code.</p>
  <p>No multiple choice quiz will help you become a proficient programmer. View this website as a "bonus resource" for your Java learning.</p>
